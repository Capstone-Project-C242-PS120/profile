# ü§ñ Machine Learning
<p align="justify">
  <b>Teja</b> is an innovative application designed to analyze food packaging and provide personalized nutritional insights and recommendations. By leveraging advanced machine learning, it integrates three core capabilities: extracting nutritional data using PaddleOCR, classifying food into nutrition grades with a neural network, and delivering tailored suggestions through a deep learning-powered content-based filtering model.

<b>Technology Highlights</b>
1. PaddleOCR: Captures and processes text from food packaging with high accuracy.
2. Neural Networks: Provides reliable classification of nutritional data into meaningful grades.
3. Deep Learning: Delivers personalized, data-driven recommendations based on user preferences.
4. FastAPI: Enables a fast, secure, and scalable API for seamless integration and interaction.
5. Docker: Simplifies deployment and scalability with a consistent containerized environment.
